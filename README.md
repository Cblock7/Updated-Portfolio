# My Portfolio Project

## Description
- This project was our first attempt at creating our own webpage from scratch. What's important about this assignment is we will be able to build upon and improve it in the future so that we are able to utilize it to showcase our work to potential employers. We had to include a variety of styling and functionality techniques to allow users to navigate to different sections of the webpage, as well as click pictures to access links to our work. This assignment proved quite difficult and I look forward to improving on this page so I can use it for my portfolio in the future!
